Ingredients:

    Batter:

        1 cup all purpose flour
        2 tbsp white granulated sugar
        1 tsp salt
        1 tsp baking powder
        1 tsp baking soda
        1/2 vanilla bean
        zest of half a lemon
        1 whole egg
        1 cup whole milk (may need less or extra depending on consistency)
        3 tbsp melted butter
        3/4 cup blueberries

    Blueberry Compote:

        1 cup blueberries
        1/2 cup rum
        1 cup water
        1/2 cup sugar

    Topping:

        1 cup maple syrup

Instructions:

    1. Start by adding the dry ingredients into a large mixing bowl. Add 1 cup all purpose flour, 2 tbsp white granulated sugar, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, and 1/2 of a skinned vanilla bean. Finish it off with the zest of half a lemon. Give the dry mix a good whisk, before adding the wet ingredients.

    2. Next add 1 egg, 1 cup whole milk (may need less or extra depending on consistency), and 3 tbsp melted butter. Whisk for 2-3 mins, or just until the lumps are smoothed out.

    3. Add in 3/4 cup blueberries. Give this a few mashes to open up the berries slightly, and then mix into the batter.

    4. Grease a skillet on high heat with a small amount of oil or butter. Ladle in the blueberry pancake batter. You can make these any size you like. Cook on each side until they are a nice golden brown. Repeat process for desired amount of pancakes.

    5. I topped my short stake with a few pads of butter and a simple blueberry compote—made by reducing 1 cup blueberries, 1/2 cup rum, 1 cup water, and 1/2 cup sugar in a small sauce pan over medium heat. Cook until the blueberries become nice and syrupy.

    6. Top that with some reduce maple syrup—made my reducing 1 cup maple syrup on high heat for 7 minutes. Enjoy!
